# Effect of Immediate vs Delayed Feedback in Video Games

This repository contains the source code and materials for a research project investigating the effectiveness of a real-time gameplay route visualization feedback system using a ghost to display the optimal route. The research explores players' preferences for receiving immediate or delayed feedback in the context of video games.

# Introduction
This project builds upon the Super Mario Bros game found at https://github.com/linhdvu14/SMB-clone by extending it with a feedback system. The original game serves as the foundation for our research, allowing us to investigate the impact of immediate versus delayed feedback on gameplay performance and user experience.

The motivation behind this research is to understand how real-time gameplay route visualization, provided through the presence of a ghost representing the optimal route, influences players' performance and preferences for feedback timing. By studying the effects of immediate versus delayed feedback, we aim to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on effective feedback mechanisms in video games.

# Abstract
The aim of this thesis is to examine the impact of immediate versus delayed feedback in video games, specifically focusing on the effectiveness of a real-time gameplay route visualization feedback system. The system utilizes a ghost to display the optimal route for players, providing them with visual guidance during gameplay.

A total of 30 participants were assigned to either an immediate or delayed feedback group in a between-subject study. The classic Super Mario Bros. game was used as the platform for a speedrun task. Various methods, including quantitative analysis, Mini Player Experience Inventory (PXI) results, and qualitative data, were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback systems.

Both the immediate and delayed feedback groups demonstrated improvements in their performance, and positive player experiences were reported. However, participants overwhelmingly preferred immediate feedback as it provided clearer information on their progress towards in-game goals.

The findings of this study suggest that feedback systems can play a vital role in facilitating learning and enhancing user experiences in gaming contexts. These results have practical implications for game designers seeking to optimize player engagement. It is important for future research to address certain limitations, such as ensuring equal training time for all levels, incorporating a control group, and exploring the potential of feedback systems in various game genres and settings.
